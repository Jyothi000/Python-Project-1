QR Code Generator Project

In this mini project, I created a custom QR code generator using Python! The goal was to generate a QR code that directs people to my LinkedIn profile. 

Hereâ€™s how I built it:

1. *Libraries Used: I used the *qrcode* library to generate the QR code and the *image** library to customize the image format.
2. *Customization*: The QR code was set with a version of 15 (which determines its size), a box size of 10 (the size of each block in the QR code), and a border thickness of 5.
3. *Adding Data: I added a URL to the QR code, in this case, my LinkedIn profile link: *https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyothi-nagam-b21a8430a**.
4. *Image Creation*: The QR code was customized with a black foreground and a white background.
5. *Saving the Image: Finally, the QR code image was saved as *"test.png"** to be shared or used anywhere.

This project demonstrates how easy it is to generate and customize QR codes for linking to websites, social profiles, and more, using Python libraries!
